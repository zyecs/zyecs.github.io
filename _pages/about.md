Greetings. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Trustworthy Machine Learning and Reasoning Group](https://github.com/tmlr-group), [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/), The University of Melbourne, working with Dr. [Feng Liu](https://fengliu90.github.io/).

I research machine learning models that can be
- **robust** to distribution shifts
- **efficient** during deployment and adaptation for new tasks
- **safe** in terms of adversarial attack and privacy breach

given the pressing needs for trustworthy machine-learning systems, in contexts of powerful *multi-modal Foundation Models* emerging nowadays.

I obtained my Ph.D. and Master's degrees from The University of New South Wales, feeling fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Lina Yao](https://www.linayao.com), where I studied uncertainty-aware and sample-efficient human-centric perceptation and understanding with limited well-annotated data.
Our research outcomes spanned multiple real-world application, such as Recommender Systems, Brain-Computer Interface, and Human Movement Predictions.
I did my undergraduate study at Southwest Jiaotong University.
